## Questions (Answer indented below)

1. What was your favorite feature to implement? Why?

    `My favorite feature to implement was the diffable data source. The diffable data source makes searching for recipes more fluid and a better user experience.`

2. What was your #1 obstacle or bug that you fixed? How did you fix it?

    `Implementing the diffable data source with multiple, custom data types was a challenge using enums that had associated values. I removed the associated values and changed the enum to use raw values which allowed me to conform to hashable more easily.`
  
3. Share a chunk of code (or file) you're proud of and explain why.

5. What is your #1 feature?

    `My favorite feature is the rotating list of recipes with full ingredients and cooking instructions.`
